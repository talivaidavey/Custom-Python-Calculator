Davey Talivai: Design and develop your own custom python calculator

# This is my Digital Custom Python Calculator Poject

### About my project
My project is a digital custom calculator suitable for young children. I have used the python coding system and VS CODE for my project. This is a working calculator that will produce an answer. We (10DT-5) were given the task to create a custom calculator. We were shown the way and were asked to make simple customizations to our calculators for example colour, and positioning. I like how far I have come from knowing nothing about coding and computers to be able to use and make different websites and create awesome things such as calculators.
