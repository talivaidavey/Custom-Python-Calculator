# A Python Calculator 

### About my project
**My Python calculator is a very suitable calculator for young learners aged 3-4. This is because ihave only added the addition or plus sign to my calculator this is because I believe 4 year olds are only just learning to use a calculator. I have used the colours yellow and green because I feel that these colours support new learning and great ideas. I have only included a add button and an equals button to complete being able to fully create and solve equations.**
